# Strava insights - A data deep dive

#### Problem:
Set up a basic data pipeline to move data from Strava via Strava API to local MYSQl database. 
This can be further extended by data exploration, analysis and communicating insights through a blog post or notebook. 
Idea is to touch the adjacent field of data engineering while working in and producing a data science product. 
Potential skills: Data pipelines, API, Python, Data orchestration (Airbyte, Meltano, etc,..), Data analysis and Story telling.
